# Text File Compression
In this project, I created some programs to encode and decode text files using the lossless Huffman compression algorithm. There are three main steps to implementing this algorithm, which I will outline below. 

<h3>Step 1: Generate</h3>
In order to encode a text file using the Huffman algorithm, each character must be assigned a unique prefix string that represents the character. This string is known as a Huffman code. Huffman codes are generated by counting the frequency of a character in a sample text. Characters with a higher frequency are assigned a shorter code, and characters with lower frequency are assigned a longer code. For my project, I assigned codes to UTF-007 through UTF-255, as well as UTF-004.
