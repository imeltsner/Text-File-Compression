# Text File Compression
In this project, I created some programs to encode and decode text files using the lossless Huffman compression algorithm. There are three main steps to implementing this algorithm, which I will outline below. 

<h3>Step 1: Generate</h3>
In order to encode a text file using the Huffman algorithm, each character must be assigned a unique prefix string that represents the character. This string is known as a Huffman code. Huffman codes are generated by counting the frequency of a character in a sample text. Characters with a higher frequency are assigned a shorter code, and characters with lower frequency are assigned a longer code. After each character is assigned a code, the codes are stored in a codebook that can be referenced for encoding and decoding. For my project, I assigned codes to UTF-007 through UTF-255, as well as UTF-004. 

<h3>Step 2: Encode</h3>
The encoding process is relativley straightforward. The program reads a text file and outputs an encoded text file. Each character of the text file is read into the program. The program then looks for the corresponding Huffman code and writes it to the output file. 

<h3>Step 3: Decode</h3>
The decoding process is just the opposite of the encoding process. First the Huffman tree is reconstructed from the codebook. Then, each 1 or 0 is read into the program. The tree is traversed until it reaches a leaf node, at which point the corresponding character is written to the output file.
